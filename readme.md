## Books
Awesome books to help you quickly learn Roslyn.

- [Roslyn Succinctly](https://www.syncfusion.com/ebooks/roslyn) by Alessandro Del Sole *(free e-book)*
- [Roslyn Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/roslyn-cookbook) by Manish Vasani
- [.NET Development Using the Compiler API](https://www.apress.com/la/book/9781484221105) by Jason Bock

## Open Source Projects
Awesome open source projects built on top of Roslyn.

- [MirrorSharp](https://github.com/ashmind/mirrorsharp) - An online C#, VB.NET, and F# code editor. Features code completion, method signature help, quick fixes, and diagnostics.
- [OmniSharp](http://www.omnisharp.net/) - Enables a cross platform .NET development in the editor of your choice. A family of open source projects, each with one goal: To enable a great .NET experience in your editor of choice.
- [roslyn-linq-rewrite](https://github.com/antiufo/roslyn-linq-rewrite) - Compiles C# code by first rewriting the syntax trees of LINQ expressions using plain procedural code. This increases performance by minimizes heap allocations and dynamic dispatch.
- [RoslynPad](https://roslynpad.net/) - A cross-platform C# editor. Features code completion, method signature help, quick fixes, and diagnostics.
- [RoslynQuoter](https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/RoslynQuoter) - A tool that for a given C# program generates syntax tree API calls that construct the syntax tree of that program.
- [scriptcs](http://scriptcs.net/) - Turns C# into a powerful scripting tool. Features C# REPL, installation of NuGet packages, execution of scripts with a single line of code.
- [Sharpen](http://sharpen.rocks) - A Visual Studio extension that intelligently introduces new C# language features into your existing code base.
- [SharpLab](https://sharplab.io/) - .NET code playground. Displays intermediate steps and results of code compilation. Shows the code as compiler sees it. Allows selecting different branches and versions of Roslyn. Runs C#, VB.NET, and F# code in the browser.
- [Testura.Code](https://github.com/Testura/Testura.Code) - A wrapper around the Roslyn API used for generation, saving and compiling C# code. Provides methods and helpers to generate classes, methods, statements and expressions.

## Open Source Analyzers, Code Fixes, and Refactorings
Awesome open source analyzers, code fixes, and refactorings.

- [.NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn") Analyzers](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers) - Diagnostic analyzers developed by the Roslyn team. Initially developed to help flesh out the design and implementation of the static analysis APIs. The analyzers cover code quality, .NET Core, desktop .NET Framework, comments in code, and more.
- [Code Cracker](https://github.com/code-cracker/code-cracker) - An analyzer library for C# and VB. Offers diagnostics in many categories like performance, coding styles, as well as some basic refactorings.
- [Refactoring Essentials for Visual Studio](https://github.com/icsharpcode/RefactoringEssentials/) - Refactorings, analyzers and code fixes for C# and VB.
- [Roslyn Clr Heap Allocation Analyzer](https://github.com/Microsoft/RoslynClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer) - A C# heap allocation analyzer that can detect explicit and many implicit allocations like boxing, display classes a.k.a closures, implicit delegate creations, etc.
- [Roslynator](https://github.com/JosefPihrt/Roslynator) - A collection of 190+ analyzers and 190+ refactorings for C#. Covers coding style, code readability and simplification, removing redundancies, fixing compiler errors and many more.
- [StyleCop Analyzers for the .NET Compiler Platform](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers) - A port of StyleCop rules to Roslyn.
