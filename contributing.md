## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, making a pull request adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your pull request before we merge it. There's no need to open a new pull request, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your pull request so that we can merge it.
